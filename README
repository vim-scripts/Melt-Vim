Plugin for Melt (http://melt.forge.ocamlcore.org/) files: 
- syntax colouring (with handling of spelling) 
- filetype detection 
- filetype plugin 
- compiler plugin 

Features: 
* automatic detection of .mlt files 
* syntax coloration 
* compiler error handling (i.e. go to the location of the error indicated by Melt - warning: approximative) 
* handling of spelling, english is the default, see :h spell for more details 
* and the following commands: 

+ normal mode: 
 - gf on a module name will open the corresponding file 

+ visual mode (xxx denotes the selected text, xxx -> ... means "xxx is rewritten as ..."): 
 - <LocalLeader>": xxx -> "xxx" (i.e. inserts quotes around xxx) 
 - <LocalLeader>(: xxx -> (xxx) 
 - <LocalLeader>{: xxx -> {xxx} 
 - <LocalLeader>[: xxx -> [xxx] 
 - <LocalLeader>cc: xxx -> (*xxx*) 
 - <LocalLeader>e: xxx -> {emph "xxx"} 
 - <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>: ask for a string s (typically a caml function), then xxx -> {s "xxx"} 
Note: <LocalLeader> is generally bound to ',' 

+ if the matchit plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39) is installed then '%' will switch between struct/end, let/in, match/with, ... 

+ if the Nerd commenter plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218) is installed then its usual commands handle melt comments 

+ if you set the variable g:MeltCloseDelimiters then: 
 - typing " will write "" and put the cursor between the quotes 
 - typing ( will write () and put the cursor between the parentheses 
 - typing { will write {} and put the cursor between the braces 
 - typing [ will write [] and put the cursor between the brackets 

+ main rule to detect the compiler for :make (see compiler/melt.vim for details): 
1. if there is a Makefile then :make launches make 
2. if there is a myocamlbuild.ml then :make launches ocamlbuild 
3. otherwise launch melt
